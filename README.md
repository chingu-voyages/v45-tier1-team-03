## Tech Stack

HTML, CSS, VanillaJS, Leaflet.js

## Git Strategy

### Pull Requests & Merging

All Pull Requests and code merging will take place in the project's Github repo. To reduce merge conflicts, the destination branch should be pulled into the merging branch prior to opening a pull request. To test changes and review a PR locally before approving it, read modifying an active pull request locally. For the purposes of testing, just use the commands in "Step 1" which brings the PR local. After testing, you can go back to Github and approve or comment on the PR.

### Development Branch

Working branches will be merged into the development branch during weekly development. At least one team member other than the requester must review and approve a request before it can be merged. After the merge has been approved, the requester will perform the merge on Github and delete the merged branch from the repository upon a successful merge. If any merge conflicts occur, the requester must work with the author of the conflicting code to resolve them and re-submit the PR for approval.

### Master Branch

A PR to merge to the master should reflect the goals of the prior week's sprint and produce an updated MVP. This PR will typically take place following the weekly sprint meeting. All team members must approve a request for merging into the master branch.

## 🚀 Development Workflow

A three-level hierarchy of branches is used, through which changes are promoted.

### Working branches:

Individual branches created by each developer when they are working on changes and bug fixes. The type can be one of these types:
- feature: a new feature
- fix: a bug fix
- docs: changes to documentation
- style: formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change
- refactor: refactoring production code
- test: adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change
- chore: updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production code change basic types of branches:

### Development:

Reflects the code for the next release. Developers work in working branches, which are then pulled into this branch. All code pulled into this branch must be tested and undergo peer review as part of the PR process.

### Master:

Only updated from the development branch Pull Requests. This branch always reflects the current production release that is seen by live users.
